# Spell-Checker

Authors :  Soutik Chakraborty & Abhishek Gupta

Organization : University of Washington

A basic implementation of the spell checker inspired by Peter Norvig's implementation (http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html)

We made a small modification to the implementation to see a change of 4% in accuracy while loosing the speed of excecution. 

Next Steps:

1. Implement a bi-gram model of the same

2. Implement n-gram model after bi-gram model is successful.
